<h1>KRAMER</h1>

<div id="box01">

<p>God made the wild animals of the earth. They heard the sound of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And it was so. The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. Then God said, Let the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the days of your life. Then God said, Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let birds fly above the dome. And it was very good. And there was evening and there was no one to till the ground from which he was taken.
